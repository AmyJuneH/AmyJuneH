I am AmyJune Hineline, and the Senior Community Manager at <a href="hhttps://opensource.com/">Opensource.com</a>,
a project supported by Red Hat. I am also a Drupal Core Mentor. With a dual
focus on both open-source community development and inclusivity, I am uniquely
positioned to help individuals become more comfortable and confident as they
contribute to their communities. I co-organizes various open-source camps
and conventions globally, empowering individuals to forge deep community
connections that benefit the whole. As a self-described non-coder, I
help communities discover how they can contribute and belong in more ways than code. 


With six years of open-source community involvement behind me, Iâ€™ve had the
opportunity to become actively involved in both the Drupal, Accessibilty, and WordPress
communities: working to lower the barrier to entry in tech though my leadership
of first-time contributor workshops at the local and regional level. 

My ongoing experience as a hospice nurse keeps me in touch with the challenges
faced by many end-users. In my continued efforts to make a difference, I help
organize <a href="https://www.a11ytalks.com">A11yTalks</a>, an online meetup where we invite folks on every month to
talk about all things accessibility - one of the core components of building an
inclusive web. 

I am a graduate of <a href="https://academy.drupaleasy.com" target="_blank">DrupalEasy</a>. <a href="https://academy.drupaleasy.com/users/amyjunehineline" target="_blank">View my profile here</a>.

Other Gems and Oddities include but aren't limited to:
- I am the youngest of five sisters and have survived, proving I am either good at communicating or at talking myself out of deadly situations.
- I am a mycology aficionado who geocaches in the woods.
- I can spell the word diarrhea without the aid of spellcheck, but hopefully in tech this will be an under utilized skill.

- Pronouns: she/her/hers
