Other Gems and Oddities include, but are not limited to:

 * I am a mycology aficionado who geocaches in the woods.

 * Being the youngest of five sisters, I have proved that I am really good at communication or at talking myself out of deadly situations.

 * I like to play the guitar, but in actuality, I have my headphones on and while listening to someone better and imagining it's me.
