# Hi, I'm AmyJune

I am AmyJune Hineline, and I am the Open Source Community Ambassador at <a href="https://www.kanopi.com">Kanopi Studios</a>.
With a dual focus on both open-source community development and
inclusivity, I am uniquely positioned to help individuals become more
comfortable and confident as they contribute to their communities. I co-organize
various open-source camps and conventions throughout North America, empowering
individuals to forge deep community connections that benefit the whole. As a
self-described non-coder, I help communities discover how they can contribute
and belong in more ways than coding. 

With five years of open-source community involvement behind me, Iâ€™ve had the
opportunity to become actively involved in both the Drupal and WordPress
communities: working to lower the barrier to entry in tech though my leadership
of first-time contributor workshops at the local and regional level. 

My ongoing experience as a hospice nurse keeps me in touch with the challenges
faced by many end-users. In my continued efforts to make a difference, I help
organize <a href="https://www.a11ytalks.com">A11yTalks</a>, an online meetup where we invite folks on every month to
talk about all things accessibility - one of the core components of building an
inclusive web. 

Outside of my mission in the technology community space, I have a deep love for
mycology, geocaching, and air-cooled Volkswagens.
